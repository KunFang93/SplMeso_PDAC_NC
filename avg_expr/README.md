This code describes how we compared data from the current study to data from previous studies.


DE genes according to the MAST test and ordered by fold-change (FC), shown as standardized (Z) log2(RPKM)

This is the spl_meso (splanchnic mesenchyme) geneset, ordered by the log2ratio in the current study (PDAC/normal), and shown as normalized gene expression level; Z(log2(RPKM)). On the right hand size, is FibroXplorer and TabulaSapiens data. TabulaSapiens dataset was converted from hd5 into R objects using SeuratDisk package. Mouse/human gene mappings were done using the homologene R package.
